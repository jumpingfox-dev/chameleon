# Chameleon

Chameleon is a free and open-source, deeply customizable Jellyfin client built to adapt seamlessly across your screens with high-performance playback and personalized library layouts.

Most clients lock you into a rigid layout. Chameleon gives you complete control over your interface while maximizing direct play to keep your server quiet and cool.

## Highlights

* **Adaptive Interfaces:** Completely customize your home shelf rows, metadata layouts, and poster aspect ratios to match your library aesthetic.
* **Direct Play First:** Built to prioritize native direct streams (HEVC, AV1, HDR/Dolby Vision) to minimize server transcoding overhead.
* **Living Room & Mobile Ready:** Fluid touch controls for handheld devices paired with a first-class, snappy D-pad navigation model for Android TV and Apple TV.
* **Advanced Subtitle Engine:** Native support for styled anime subtitles (`.ass`/`.ssa`) with fine-grained control over typography, sizing, and vertical offsets.
* **Multi-Account & Server Switching:** Instant switching between local and remote server profiles without having to re-authenticate.
* **Zero Telemetry:** Completely private with no analytics, trackers, or middleman servers—your device communicates strictly with your Jellyfin instance.
